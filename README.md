# Generation

## Introduction

Generation aims to be a lifestyle app that helps with physical and mental well-being of the elderly, helping them to cope with loneliness and daily inconvenience exacerbated by Covid.

This is done in 3 ways:

1. A meetup feature for the initiated to meet new people living near them to connect with them based on similar interests and hobbies
2. For those who are less comfortable making new friends or who are looking to improve physically, there is an exercise feature for them to make more productive use of their time at home.
3. Finally, a Group Buy feature that allows elderly with mobility issues to request for delivery of goods, while encouraging Community Spirit

## Technology
